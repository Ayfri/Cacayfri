			<h2>The Subtle Art of Poop</h2>
			<p>Since the dawn of time, humanity has had a complex relationship with its own creations. Among them, the most humble, the most natural, and yet the most reviled: poop. Here at Cacayfri, we pay tribute to this daily work of art, exploring its most surprising facets and, dare we say, philosophical implications. You're welcome.</p>
			<h3>Historical Perspectives</h3>
			<p>Archaeological digs reveal ancient latrines and coprolites, showing that humans studied and even collected their excrement tens of thousands of years ago. Poop shaped rituals, medicine, and diet.</p>
			<h3>In Popular Culture</h3>
			<p>From viral memes to avant-garde gallery pieces, poop has been a recurring motif. Remember the seminal 'poop emoji'? It's now a staple of digital conversation and art installations worldwide.</p>

			<h2>Poop of the Day</h2>
			<p id="poop-of-the-day">Bristol Type 4: Like a smooth, soft sausage or snake. A timeless classic, for the unoriginal.</p>

			<h2>The Science of Excrement</h2>
			<p>Did you know that your gut flora is actually a bustling metropolis of bacteria? It works tirelessly to break down food, synthesize vitamins, and create the final masterpiece you contribute to daily. Talk about a productive ecosystem!</p>
			<ul>
				<li>98% Water: The secret to smooth operations.</li>
				<li>2% Solids: Fiber, bacteria, undigested food, and mystery.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Digestive Journey</h3>
			<p>Your meal travels from mouth to stomach, then winds through the small intestine before the large intestine reclaims water and forms solids. It's a marvel of biology!</p>
			<h3>Health Indicators</h3>
			<p>Color, shape, and consistency can reveal diet quality and gut health. Ideal poop is brown, smooth, and moderated in size. Odd hues? Consult a professional.</p>
			<h3>Untold Scientific Oddities</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Poop can reach exit velocities of up to 3&nbsp;m/s after a particularly spicy meal—scientists call this the <em>Taco Thrust</em>.</li>
				<li>Researchers at MIT once 3-D-printed a perfect replica of a wombat cube for aerodynamic testing. It flew surprisingly well.</li>
				<li>The longest recorded lab study of poop smell gradients concluded that the stench travels faster than the speed of sound in small bathrooms. (Peer review pending.)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Famous Poopers</h2>
			<p>Even the greats had bowel movements:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Albert Einstein: Once calculated the speed of his poop.</li>
				<li>Leonardo da Vinci: Sketched the perfect poop trajectory.</li>
				<li>Cleopatra: Bathing in poop or so they say.</li>
				<li>Isaac Newton: Discovered gravity from a falling apple, but was truly inspired by a different kind of falling object in the outhouse.</li>
				<li>William Shakespeare: Famously wrote, "To poop, or not to poop, that is the question."</li>
				<li>Marie Curie: Discovered two new elements, Polonium and Radium, but her secret third discovery, "Turdium," was flushed from the history books.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Modern Legends</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Elon Musk: Rumored to schedule his bathroom breaks with rocket precision.</li>
				<li>Beyoncé: Renowned for impeccable timing, on stage and off.</li>
				<li>The Beatles: Their hit song "Let It Be" was originally "Let It Pee," but they changed it to be more radio-friendly. The B-side, "The Long and Winding Load," was also scrapped.</li>

			<h2>Expert Interviews</h2>
			<p>We sat down—well, squatted—with the world's leading minds to flush out the truth.</p>
			<h3>Featured Experts</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Prof. Linda Fecalia</strong>, Chair of Stoolistics at Caca University—maps toilet turbulence with AI-powered splash sensors.</li>
				<li><strong>Sir Reginald Flushworth&nbsp;III</strong>, Royal Historian of Privy Affairs—claims King Henry&nbsp;VIII wrote breakup letters on parchment recycled from royal TP.</li>
				<li><strong>Dr. Elon Poosk</strong>, Rocket-Propelled Relief Specialist—investigates zero-G bowel movements aboard the ISS ("It's all about the thrust vectoring").</li>
				<li><strong>Stanksy</strong>, Anonymous Graffiti-Poop Artist—turns public restrooms into satirical galleries overnight.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Interview Highlights</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Prof. Fecalia on Splash Dynamics</summary>
				<p>"Our simulations show that a shallow bowl angle can cut backsplash by 42%. Unfortunately, it also doubles the acoustic resonance, making each plop sound like a timpani drum solo."</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Sir Flushworth on Historical Hygiene</summary>
				<p>"Contrary to popular belief, medieval knights carried <em>poop swords</em>—essentially oversized spatulas—for battlefield emergencies."</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Dr. Poosk on Space Poop</summary>
				<p>"In microgravity, every turd is technically an astronaut, free-floating and full of potential. We just try to keep them from achieving escape velocity."</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Stanksy on Art as Excrement</summary>
				<p>"Art is subjective. Poop is objective. Combine the two, and you have a masterpiece people can smell from across the hall."</p>
